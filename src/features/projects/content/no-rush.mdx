## Description
No Rush is a fast paced obstacle runner which places you in a 1-bit enviroment. Move your way down the platforms to escape impending doom. But don't go too fast or you might just fall to your death!

## The Ludum Dare Experience
This project was created for **Ludum Dare 34**. The theme was **"Growing,"** as well as **"Two Button Controls,"** which I implemented in a simple left- and right control scheme.

Being a **Compo** entry, I had exactly 48 hours to build everything solo. I chose a **1-bit aesthetic** not just for the style, but as a strategic decision to ensure I could produce a cohesive set of assets within the strict time limit.

## Responsibilities
Since this was a solo Compo entry, I was responsible for every facet of the project:
* **Game Design:** Balancing the speed and mechanics against player movement as well as the feel of each impact.
* **Programming:** Implementing procedural platform generation and physics in GML.
* **Art & Audio:** Hand-crafting all 1-bit sprites and synthesizing 8-bit sound effects.
