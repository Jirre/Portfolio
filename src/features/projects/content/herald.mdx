## Description
*Herald* is an interactive period drama set during the 19th century. Players take on the role of Devan Rensburg, a steward on the HLV Herald, navigating the complex social hierarchies and colonial injustices of the Age of Sail. The game seamlessly blends 3D ship exploration with high-fidelity 2D animated portraits using Live2D.

## The "Generalist" Internship
During my internship at **Wispfire**, I operated as both a **Programmer and Game Designer**. Working in a small, focused team required me to be highly versatile, moving between high-level system architecture and granular gameplay polish. This role was pivotal in teaching me how to integrate design requests while working in a system of code that had to remaind maintainable.

## Key Features & Architecture
Because the team was small, I was responsible for implementing several custom solutions from the ground up:

* **Dynamic Animation & Rigging:** I developed a custom **rope rigging system** to allow for dynamic, procedural animation of the ship’s rigging.
* **Camera & Interaction Systems:** I designed and implemented the camera behavior and a custom **cursor/hover system**, ensuring the fixed camera locations did not intersect with environment and allowed navigation.
* **Animation State Machines:** I built complex animation controllers that synchronized character movements and expressions with player inputs and branching dialogue triggers.

## Responsibilities
* **Gameplay Programming:** Developed generalist systems including interaction logic, UI feedback, and environment-specific physics (ropes/rigging).
* **Game Design:** Participated in the design process for narrative interactions, ensuring technical systems supported the game’s heavy emphasis on character development.
* **Systems Integration:** Helped integrate a dialogue system and extend upon the existing systems to support our desired features.
