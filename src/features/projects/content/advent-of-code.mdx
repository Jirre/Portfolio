Advent of Code is an annual "mental gym" in which increasigly difficult challenges force you to optimize your code to remain within reasonable execution times. In 2025, I chose to use **C#** when I partook for the first time, focussing on performance as a first priority.

## The Technical Challenge
The difficulty curve of AoC is steep. The second parts of each puzzle often require moving beyond "brute force" to more advanced concepts:
* **Graph Theory:** Implementing Dijkstra and A* for pathfinding puzzles.
* **AABB:** Instead of checking entire grids, often it is better to make coordinate based checks instead.
* **Parsing:** Using Regex and custom parsers to handle complex input strings.

## What I Gained
* **Performance Optimization:** Several puzzles required reducing execution time from minutes to milliseconds through better data structure selection.
