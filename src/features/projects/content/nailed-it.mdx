## Description
Developed while I was employed by **Paladin Studios** for **Netflix Games**, *Nailed It! Baking Bash* brings the chaotic energy of the hit Netflix series to mobile devices. Players compete against friends in a series of high-pressure mini-games to see who can best recreate complex cakes—often with hilarious, messy results.

## Large-Scale Studio Collaboration
I joined Paladin Studios during a peak phase of development, working within a **large-scale team of 20-40 professionals**. Operating at this scale required high-level coordination across multiple departments, including specialized UI designers, QA testers, and producers, to ensure the game met the rigorous quality standards of the Netflix Games platform.

## Key Contributions:
* **Mini-game Engineering:** Developed several rapid-fire gameplay sequences, focusing on fun but difficult "baking" mechanics that translate well to touchscreens and work in a competitive and quick paced environment.
* **Narrative Systems:** Assisted in the implementation of the dialogue system, bringing the show’s signature humor and host interactions into the game flow.
* **Goal & Achievement Logic:** Developed the backend-facing system for tracking player goals and challenges. This system managed the "achievements" and long-term milestones that drive player retention in the single-player and multiplayer modes.

## Responsibilities
* **Game Logic:** Programming various mini-games from concept to polish, ensuring they met the quality standards of a major licensed IP.
* **UI/UX Integration:** Working closely with designers to implement a dialogue system that felt native to the *Nailed It!* brand.
* **System Design:** Architecting the challenge-tracking system to be extensible, allowing the design team to easily add new goals and rewards.
