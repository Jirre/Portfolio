This website serves as both a professional showroom and a technical sandbox. The goal was to build a system that allows for seamless content creation via MDX while maintaining the performance benefits of a statically generated site.

## Architecture
The site is built using the **Next.js App Router** and utilizes a file-system-based "Content API." Finally I utilize the **Bulletproof** folder structure to maintain readability.

### Key Technical Systems:
* **Custom MDX Pipeline:** I developed a utility that parses local MDX files, extracts frontmatter for the gallery's sorting logic, and dynamically injects React components into the markdown body.
* **Inverted Data Fetching:** To optimize build times, I implemented a targeted fetching logic that only reads necessary files instead of crawling the entire directory for every page request.
* **Dynamic Media Gallery:** Built a modular gallery component that detects media types (Local Video, Image, or YouTube) and renders the appropriate optimized player.
* **Responsive Design:** Using **Tailwind CSS**, I architected a fluid layout that handles complex data grids for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
