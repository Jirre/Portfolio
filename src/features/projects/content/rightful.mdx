## Description
A Tower Defense with a cycle of 10 seconds. An unstoppable horde of monsters tries to drive you from this newly found island, but with the help of a plethora of towers you will need to defend yourself, gather resources and expand your island.

New Enemies are at your gates every 10 seconds. Your resources are stocked up every 10 seconds.

With a fully randomly generated map and path, you never know what to expect!

## The Ludum Dare Experience
Created for **Ludum Dare 51** under the theme **"Every 10 Seconds,"** *Rightful* is a tower defense game where players must strategically place defenses, their resources and new waves spawn every 10 seconds. This project marked my return to the game jam scene after several years of professional development, allowing me to apply industry-standard practices to a rapid prototype.

## Professional Polish
While many jam games ignore the "boring" parts of development, my primary goal for *Rightful* was to implement a **professional-grade options menu**. I wanted to prove that even a 48-hour project could provide a robust user experience:
* **Graphics & Audio:** Implemented granular settings for quality levels, resolution, and independent volume mixers.
* **Input Remapping:** Ensured the game was accessible by providing clear UI feedback for control schemes.

## Personal Library
This was the first project to utilize **JvLib**, my personal suite of Unity tools and utilities. By leveraging my own library, I was able to bypass the "boilerplate" stage of the jam and move straight into unique gameplay mechanics:
* **Data Management:** Used my custom data architecture to handle game different data values and easily read said values through my access layer.
* **Extension Methods:** Leveraged shorthand utilities for faster UI and math implementation.
* **Modular Systems:** Integrated pre-built audio and fade-transition managers, allowing for a more polished feel in a fraction of the time.

## Responsibilities
* **Solo Development:** Handled all coding, system architecture, and game balancing within the 48-hour limit.
* **System Integration:** Carefully selected and integrated 3D assets from the Unity Asset Store to maintain a consistent visual style while focusing heavily on the programming.
* **Technical Design:** Architected the "10-second pulse" system that triggers wave spawning and resource gathering, ensuring the code remained clean despite the time constraints.
