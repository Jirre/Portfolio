## Description
The Snollebollekes App was designed to bridge the gap between fans and live performances during the COVID pandemic. We used Augmented Reality and a real-time multiplayer game to create a promotional game in which we were able to create a "virtual stadium" experience where users could watch a live-projected concert and compete in multiplayer mini-games.

## Key Features & Architecture
The project's complexity stemmed from the synchronization of three major pillars:
* **Augmented Reality:** We used **Vuforia** to track and project a "live concert" onto real-world surfaces, allowing users to experience the performance from any angle in their own environment.
* **Real-time Communication:** Implemented **SignalR** to handle low-latency communication between players, enabling synchronized gameplay and live interaction during the concert.
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** Utilized **PlayFab** for comprehensive LiveOps, e-commerce and profile management. I developed the backend logic using **JavaScript** (CloudScript) to manage online user-data storage, leaderboards, and real-time event updates.

## Responsibilities
* **Team Management:** Led a team of 4 programmers, delegating tasks across UI, AR, and backend systems while maintaining a cohesive codebase.
* **Backend Development:** Engineered the cloud infrastructure using PlayFab and JavaScript to handle secure user data and competitive live-ops.
* **AR Integration:** Oversaw the implementation of Vuforia tracking to ensure "live" projections on a wide range of mobile hardware.
* **Multiplayer Logic:** Architected the SignalR integration within Unity to support real-time state synchronization across thousands of devices.
