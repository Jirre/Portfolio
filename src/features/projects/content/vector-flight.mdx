## Description
Vector Flight is a high-octane, local co-op twin-stick shooter designed for up to four players. Set in a minimalist neon environment, players must coordinate their movement and fire-power to survive endless waves of increasingly complex enemy patterns.

## Award-Winning Design
Vector Flight received significant critical acclaim during its festival run, proving the strength of its core mechanical loop and accessibility.
* **Winner:** Best Student Game Design — *Dutch Game Awards 2015*
* **Winner (Tied 1st):** Audience Award — *Indigo 2016*

## Vertex Art
As a solo developer, I wanted to create a striking visual identity without relying on traditional 2D sprites. I developed a system to **render line-art created through programming**, using vertex-based math to draw shapes directly in the engine. This allowed for:
* **Perfect Scaling:** Visuals remain crisp at any resolution.
* **Dynamic Animations:** Shapes can shift, glow, and react to game logic in real-time.
* **Performance:** Extremely lightweight rendering, allowing for hundreds of projectiles on screen simultaneously.

## Balancing & Feel
With four players sharing one screen, "readability" was the biggest challenge. I spent the majority of development iterating on the **Game Design** and **Balancing**:
* **Difficulty Scaling:** Implemented a system that scales enemy density and bullet speed based on the collective performance of the players using heat-maps and section-patterns.
* **Co-op Synergy:** Designed enemy patterns that encourage players to cover different angles, making the game feel significantly different when played solo vs. with a full group.
* **Input Polish:** Fine-tuned the twin-stick deadzones and acceleration to ensure "pixel-perfect" dodging.

## Responsibilities
* **Solo Development:** Handled all programming, math-based art generation, and sound implementation.
* **Game Design:** Focused on the mathematical balancing of bullet patterns and player power-ups.
