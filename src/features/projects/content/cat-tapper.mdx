## Description
In a world where interdimensional-shapeshifting-cats have taken over the universe you are tasked with petting them until they drop. Tap their hats and gain their ramen!

## The Ludum Dare Experience
This project was created for **Ludum Dare 35**. The theme was **"Shapeshift,"** which was difficult to pick a game for, eventually to fit with the desire of the fellow artist to make lots of different designs, we decided to form our game around the concept of cats that shapeshift into different objects and stereotypes.

As it was part of a **Gamejam**, we had 72 hours to build the entire game. It was the first time I did a gamejam with someone else which meant it was a challenging but fun new experience.

## Responsibilities
Joining forces with an artist, it allowed me to focus fully on the gameplay and programming
* **Programming:** Implementing the dialogue system and general animation/shop implementation in GML, this was the first time I truly stumbled against the limitations that GML at the time had, thus reinforcing my desire to move to a more mature engine like Unity.
* **Game Design:** Balancing the leveling speed, health and general dialogue. Due to it being a second priority compared to making everything work, the balancing was definitely a second priority.
