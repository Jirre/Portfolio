Festicoin was a ticket- and payment app for festivals and events that allowed users to keep a digital wallet, top-up their funds, and even use said funds on multiple associated events to order drinks and other products.

Sadly, after the Covid outbreak, all events were canceled, meaning the app was abandoned.

## Responsibilities
As the only front-end developer, I worked with a handful of people to realize this app. Development began shortly before my arrival at the company, thus, many choices and decisions were made before I could join. Nevertheless, over time, I became the lead developer on this project and participated in multiple live-testing situations where the app was deployed on festivals.
* **Programming:** Implementing and maintaining the code-base that was originally developed by the company but had become outdated by the time I arrived.
* **System Architecture:** Implementing many seperate systems like QR-code generation and scanning, API-integration, and several feature integrations that were requested
* **Testing and Deployment:** As the lead-developer, I was relied upon during deployment to maintain and fix issues that arrose during events.

## Fellow Credits
As an employee at **Roxelane BV**, I worked with several artists, designers, and other employees to fully implement the desired features.
